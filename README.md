# budget-app
Ruby Half Capstone Project

This will be a small comand-line program where the user can keep track of how much money they are spending and how much is being saved. 

These are the feautures that the user will have:
  
  -Inserts the amount they get paid weekly(or every 2 weeks).
  -Inserts how much they want to spend weekly(or every 2 weeks).
  -Inserts the amount they spend per purchase.
  -The app subtracts the difference.
  -What is left goes into a "savings account" in the app.
