# budget-app
Ruby Half Capstone Project

This will be a small comand-line program where the user can keep track of how much money they are spending and how much is being saved. 

These are the feautures that the user will have:

    (1)The user will be directed to a menu page that will have 3 choices.
        1.Add a new Budget!
        2.Update a Project!
        3.Exit
    (2)To start user will chose 1 and will be asked to inserts their weekly income(or every 2 weeks).
    (3)Then it will tell the user to inserts how much they want to spend weekly(or every 2 weeks).
    (4)The user will be able to update their budget by going to the home menu and choosing 2.
    (8)The user will be able to update or delete their data. The program will ask the user if they want to continue updating their budget or deleting it. 
        -If the user choses to continue then the program will ask the user to insert the amount they spend per purchase.
        -If the user choses to delete the budget then it will take them back to the home menu.
    (6)The app subtracts the difference. The user will be able to see the results on the same page. There will be a total that shows the difference and what is left.
    (7)What is left goes into a "savings account" in the app.
