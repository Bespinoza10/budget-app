# budget-app
Ruby Half Capstone Project

This will be a small comand-line program where the user can keep track of how much money they are spending and how much is being saved. 

These are the feautures that the user will have:

    (1)The user will start with a new entry
  
    (2)Inserts the amount they get paid weekly(or every 2 weeks).
    
    (3)Inserts how much they want to spend weekly(or every 2 weeks).
    
    (4)Inserts the amount they spend per purchase.
    
    (5)The app subtracts the difference. The user will be able to see the results on the same page. There will be a total that shows the difference and what is left.
    
    (6)What is left goes into a "savings account" in the app. 
    
    (7)The user will be able to update or delete their data. The program will ask the user if they want to modify or continue. If the user inserts "Modify" then the program will ask if they would like to delete the entry or modify.
